# The-perfect-curry-date
Code in place, final project: a game about making the perfect curry for your special one!

# Task: Create a pixel python game "The perfect curry date night". 
## Level I: Grow a garden. 
Grow rice and rajma, along with spices (bay leaf, cinnamon, jeera, black cardamom, clove, black pepper, haldi, mirch, and coriander), vegetables (onion, ginger, garlic, and tomato), and rock salt. Need to make users plant and grow foodstuffs (maintain sunlight, water, and mining work) until the required product is produced. 
## Level II: Court a partner. 
Through a hot air balloon, deliver love letters till the partner's love meter is full. The user needs to input letters that show love felt emotions until it fills a bar. And while delivering letters themselves, they need to avoid being hit by birds, and get a speed boost from a cupid bow.
## Level III: Stir a perfect curry. 
Mix, fry the produce from Level I optimally so that the perfect curry and rice are made. 
Last screen: shows a hot plate of curry rice and the partner kissing the user on the cheek on a dinner table.
